# Quick overview
1. First of all you have activate the conda environment specified in `environment.yml` file.
2. Then you can generate your own images (or use already created ones in `created_images` directory): ```python image_generator.py```
3. Then you have to reorder them: ```python prepare_images.py```
4. Then train you neural network: ```python train.py```
5. Finally, check out  your result: ```python image_predictor.py``` <br>
